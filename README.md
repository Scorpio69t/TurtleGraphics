Basic C parser for logo turtle

This project was completed as part of MSc computer science C module. It provides a parser for a simplified 
Logo language input as a .txt file.
3 modules:
parser - ensures that the input file has correct grammar;
interpreter - interprets the file and outputs in SDL, runs until an issue found;
conversion - converts file to C and provides a runnable file.
